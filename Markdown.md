Committing the time will be second nature, however I can be overly ambitious and invest a full day one day, but do nothing the next. 
All aspects of design seem to interest me, so at times I know it will be difficult to focus. I will endulge going down a learning rabbit hole and forget the task at hand! 
In order to avoid the lulls and keep up momentum I will need to remember that this is training for a marathon and every training day counts! 
Foraging is a daily habit, I just need to make sure I can come back out of the woods. 
The importance of mentorship cannot be emphasized enough and I am so grateful Bloc makes it an integral part of the program. 
I am good at asking questions, but not good at asking for help, so this is an area I will seek to improve. 
I am the least satisfied in sucess and most content when I know there is somethign to work on. I am buckled in for the rollercoaster!
